            <p class="about-p"><span class="intro">W</span>elcome to the Leftist News Network! The purpose of this site is to act as a centralized informational hub for left independent media.
            You will find information and links for various YouTube, Podcasts, Twitch and magazine content creators. These individuals and ogranizations are all growing in popularity but
            we have still not made it to the level of changing the mainstream media narrative. The left needs to band together to make this work. My goal is to help commit to this in the long run.
            </p>
            <p class="about-p">For the newcomers who stumble upon this site and are curious. The left represents policy positions such as Medicare for All, Green New Deal, College for all, LGTBQ+ equality,  establishing unions and
            changing the gross inequalities of wealth and power. These are just a few of the many policies the left stands for. We represent the needs of the many and not the few. Check out any one of the content creators
            on this site. All offer various scenarios and tactics in which the left can succeed. We are all in this together. Let's fight together.      
            </p>
            <p class="about-p">If you're able, take the time to donate to these amazing individuals, or you can join any of the leftist organizations. All of these go out of their way to promote leftist ideas and help change the dynamic of our current
                political system. You will find a link to patreon if availaible to donate.

            somebody who might be of a different religion than you, maybe they come from a different country. My question to you is: <b>Are you willing to fight for that person
