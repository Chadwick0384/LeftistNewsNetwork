            <p class="about-p"><span class="intro">W</span>elcome to the Leftist News Network! The purpose of this site
                is to act as a centralized informational hub for left independent media.
                You will find information and links for various YouTube, Podcasts, Twitch and magazine content creators.
                These individuals and ogranizations are all growing in popularity but
                we have still not made it to the level of changing the mainstream media narrative. The left needs to
                band together to make this work. My goal is to help commit to this in the long run.
            </p>
            <p class="about-p">For the newcomers who stumble upon this site and are curious. The left represents policy
                positions such as Medicare for All, Green New Deal, College for all, LGTBQ+ equality, establishing
                unions and
                changing the gross inequalities of wealth and power. These are just a few of the many policies the left
                stands for. We represent the needs of the many and not the few. Check out any one of the content
                creators
                on this site. All offer various scenarios and tactics in which the left can succeed. We are all in this
                together. Let's fight together.
            </p>
            <p class="about-p">If you're able take the time to donate to these amazing individuals! Without us they
                don't have a platofrm to work from. All of these content creators go out of their way to promote leftist
                ideas and help change
                the dynamic of our current
                political system. You will find a link to each creators patreon if availaible to donate or join.

        <p class="quote">"I want you all to take a look around and find someone you don't know. Maybe somebody who
            doesn't look kind of like you, maybe
            somebody who might be of a different religion than you, maybe they come from a different country. My
            question to you is: <b>Are you willing to fight for that person
                who you don't even know as much as you're willing to fight for yourself?</b>" -Bernie Sanders
